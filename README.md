A recommender system prototype that focuses on integrating the nearest neighbour model and big data analysis to provide users with recommended assets based on their investor profile. There will also be a sub-feature that makes additional recommendation that suggests similar assets of what usersâ€™ have bookmarked. The advantage of the proposed system is its usage of ETF assets which provides recommendations that are cost effective in diversifying, making it accessible to everyone. 

This project will be primarily using Flask framework for its web application, with Python for its backend while HTML and CSS for its front-end, SQLite for data storage and data mining, and the nearest neighbour algorithm for analysing the data and implementing the recommender system.
